# Unexpected Behavior with Responsive @apply in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with responsive modifiers. The issue arises from the inconsistent application of classes based on screen size, possibly due to escaping issues or incorrect scoping of the `@apply` directive.

## Bug Description

Applying Tailwind classes conditionally using `@apply` within responsive modifiers doesn't always work as expected.  The class may not be applied at the correct breakpoint, or it may be applied incorrectly at all breakpoints.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` (if necessary) to install dependencies.
3. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior of the class application based on screen size.

## Solution

The solution involves avoiding the direct use of `@apply` within responsive modifiers.  Instead, use a combination of standard Tailwind class names and responsive modifiers to achieve the desired behavior.  See `bugSolution.html` for a demonstration.

## Additional Notes

This bug might be related to version incompatibilities in Tailwind CSS or its integration with other tools. Please ensure you are using the latest stable versions of all related software components.
